# Rasterizations - First C# Forms Program
Made for computer engineering course in PUC Minas - SÃ£o Gabriel MG/Brazil. 

A program to draw lines and circles using DDA and Bresenham algorithms. 
It was asked to implement the DDA and Bresenham algorithms without keyboard inputs.

#How To

Download the files, open the project with Visual Studio, and compile it. 
Once it runs, click in two places on the white panel and click in the desired algorithm (to lines) or in the "Draw" button to circles.

#Need To Do

- Finish the "transformations" section to lines and circles, and correct the "no point" translation problem.
- Add Rotation to the trhansformations section.
- Move the XY axis to the lower - left corner of the screen to show the coordinates correctly.
- Make a screen with how the program works
- Learn more and clean the code.
